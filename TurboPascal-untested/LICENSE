NOTES:
------

* The original webswag.rar suggested that the default license should be the GPL,
  but this seems to be an arbitrary choice by the original packager, and counter
  to the public domain spirit of SWAG.

* The only (other) currently active SWAG mirror as of 2013 is http://kd5col.info/swag/
  maintained by Sean Dennis, which suggests the "BSD license", and provides a links to
  the http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

* The third clause of the 3-clause BSD license	reads:

> Neither the name of the <ORGANIZATION> nor the names of its contributors
> may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without
> specific prior written permission."

As the Sourceware Archive Group has been defunct for over a decade and a half now,
and was never a legally existing entity anyway, this clause doesn't seem particularily
meaningful.
