# swag-pascal

A collection of old Turbo Pascal files from SWAG, the sourceware archive group. 
Port to Free Pascal of a few of them.

Most of them cannot be ported, because many of the original examples used ASM 
or MsDos-only features, so only some of them compile and work properly under 
Free Pascal.

Approximate number of source files (currently):

- Original Turbo Pascal examples: 4.188

- Tested and working with Free Pascal: 395 (more to come)

- Remaining untested examples: 1.085
