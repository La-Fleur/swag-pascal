# swag-pascal

A collection of old Turbo Pascal files from SWAG, the sourceware archive group. 
Port to Free Pascal of a few of them (because many of the original examples
used ASM or MsDos-only features, so just a few compile and work properly under
Free Pascal).

Approximate number of source files:

- Original Turbo Pascal examples: 4.188

- Tested with Free Pascal: 40 (more to come)
